\chapter{Normalization/Standardization of T2W-MRI and DCE-MRI Images} \label{chap:5}
\Ac{cad} systems are usually designed as a sequential process consisting of four stages: pre-processing, segmentation, registration, and classification.
We presented in \acs{sec}\,\ref{subsubsec:ch3:mriprepro} the state-of-the-art techniques for normalization/standardization of \ac{mri} modality among other pre-processing steps.
As a conclusion, we can stress that only little attention has been dedicated to this topic.
Data normalization is, however, a crucial and important step of the chain to design a robust classifier and overcome the inter-patient intensity variations.

In this chapter, we focus on the normalization of \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} and \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} modalities.
On the one hand, we investigate two novel \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} normalization methods based on (i) Rician \emph{a priori} and (ii) \ac{srsf} representation and compare them with the state-of-the-art methods.
On the other hand, we propose and investigate a fully automated framework for \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} normalization, the first of its kind.
