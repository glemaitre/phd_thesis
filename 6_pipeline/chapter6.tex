\chapter{Proposed CAD system for CaP}\label{chap:6}

In this chapter, we develop and investigate a \ac{cad} system for the \ac{cap} detection, using all \ac{mri} modalities, namely \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dw}-\ac{mri}, and \ac{mrsi}.
Furthermore, we address some of the issues drawn in the conclusion of \acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:3}: (i) the methods investigated in \acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:5} are used in the pre-processing step of the proposed \ac{cad}; (ii) the discriminative power of each individual modality is investigated; (iii) the problem of learning from imbalanced dataset is investigated using state-of-the-art methods as well as (iv) several strategies for feature selection and combination.

Therefore, the organization of this chapter is as follows: the methodology is described in \acs{sec}\,\ref{sec:chp6:method} by presenting the image regularization framework as well as the image classification framework. \Acl{sec}~\ref{sec:chp6:exp-res} provides different experiments to investigate the performance of the proposed \ac{cad} system. This chapter is concluded by a concise discussion in \acs{sec}\,\ref{sec:chp6:discussion}.
